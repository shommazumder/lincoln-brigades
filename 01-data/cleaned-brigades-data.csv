"Carter was born in Los Angeles, California on May 26, 1916. His parents Mary, who traced her ancestry to India, and Rev. Edward, Sr. who was born in Kansas, were missionaries. While their son was still a toddler, the Carters embarked on mission work that took the family first to India before they settled in Shanghai, China. Carter was educated in a Chinese military school. He exhibited an early aptitude for the military arts and a knack for foreign languages (he spoke Mandarin, German and Hindi his mother's native language). While still a teen, Carter ran away from home and joined the Chinese Army. He rapidly advanced in rank, earning the rank of Lieutenant before his Commander discovered Carter's true age and ordered his discharge. Carter returned to the United States around 1936 and found employment as a seaman. He decided to enlist in the war to save the Spanish Republic and went to Spain on his own. Archival records do not reveal his whereabouts during the Spanish Civil War, perhaps because he used an unknown alias. From a subsequent interview he appears to have participated in the fighting around Teruel. According to his biographers, Carter was held as a prisoner of war before escaping and returning home on his own. Carter reappeared in Los Angeles in 1940. He enlisted in the U. S. Army on September 26, 1941. While training at Camp Benning, he was interviewed by the post newspaper. He eventually was shipped in a segregated unit to Europe. After a long struggle he finally found his way into a combat unit early in 1945. During an engagement with enemy forces in Germany in March 1945, Carter personally killed a number of German soldiers and captured two, despite sustaining six wounds. He was awarded the Purple Heart and a Silver Star. He was honorably discharged from the Army in September 1945. He subsequently worked in the Los Angeles area, before reenlisting in the U.S. Army in 1947, but in 1949 he was refused permission to reenlist. According to his biographers, no official reason was given for his banishment, though his service in Spain apparently raised questions about his loyalty. Carter died on January 30 1963 in Los Angeles. Edward Allen Carter, Jr. was among seven African American servicemen whose actions in World War II were reviewed and whose decorations for valor were upgraded to our country's highest military award: the Congressional Medal of Honor. President Bill Clinton presented the award to Carter's family in 1996 and his body was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. In 2001 a merchant ship was named in his honor.",Edward Carter,http://www.alba-valb.org/volunteers/edward-allen-carter-jr,NA,Edward,Carter

"Simon Samuel Krafsur was a Boston-born journalist who worked for the Soviet news agency TASS during World War II. He was also known as Bill Krafsur.

Krafsur was mentioned in the Venona intercepts under the codename IDE. He was used by the KGB during the war as a source of information and for recruiting journalists as informants and agents, and is referred to in the NSA archives as a ""KGB agent"".

In the 1930s Krafsur joined the Communist Party of America. He attended Northeastern University for a year. He lived at 68 Phillips Street in Boston before going to Spain to fight with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade during the Spanish Civil War, where he was wounded in 1937.

In 1938 Krafsur was a member of the editorial staff of ""The Volunteers for Liberty"" a newspaper which was an, ""organ of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade"" organization out of 125 West 45 Street in New York City. In April 1938 he was in charge of finding veterans to tell their war stories to be made into radio plays written by Irwin Shaw.

He began working for TASS in 1941 after being recruited by the Soviet agent Vladimir Pravdin. He became the assistant to the manager Laurence Todd at the Washington sub-bureau.[1] Krafsur was considered an important asset to the KGB because of the many contacts he had with other newsmen. He was the deputy TASS bureau chief in Washington, D.C. and the FBI spent a lot of time and effort trying to identify who he was under his codename IDE.

In May 1944, he was described in a KGB cable from New York to Moscow as, ""absolutely devoted to the USSR."" He provided at least twenty leads of people for possible recruitment including Joseph Berger, a personal aide to the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and I. F. Stone.

In 1949, Laurence Todd was relieved of his managing duties and instead given the title of senior corresponmdent. In this same year Krafsur left TASS and was later called before the House Committee on Un-American Activities where he chose not to cooperate. Later he worked in a toy store.

In the early 1960s he married the ex-wife of the secretary-treasurer of the Mine, Mill, and Smelters Union. He died, at the age of seventy, in St. Petersburg, Florida in 1983 under the name ""Samuel Krafsur"".",Samuel Conway Krafsur,http://www.alba-valb.org/volunteers/samuel-conway-krafsur,NA,Samuel,Krafsur

"His parents emigrated from Russia to England where he was born.  They then emigrated to the United States when he was ten years old.  They settled in Detroit, MI.  He was raised Catholic, but when he became a POW, he had asked a Catholic priest for help (of what kind, he never told my aunt or mother) and the priest spat at him.  From then on he was estranged from the Catholic church and when he met my grandmother (Lorraine Ratke)he followed her to the Lutheran church.  He worked for the Ford auto company until he moved to Milwaukee, WI in 1938/39.  He married my grandmother in 1941 in Milwaukee, WI.   He was a Volunteer with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.

"Peter Assheton Sturgeon (November 22, 1916 – July 22, 2005) was the founder of the American branch of Mensa and the older brother of noted American science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon.

He was the son of Edward Molineaux Waldo, a paint manufacturer, and Christine Hamilton Dicker, a writer and political activist. His parents divorced when he was a child and in 1929 his mother married William Dicky Sturgeon, an emigrant Scottish college professor. Peter and his brother Ted were educated in the Philadelphia public school system.

After high school he joined the Communist Party and fought on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War as a volunteer with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. The writer William Tenn has stated that Sturgeon became involved with POUM while in Spain and fell into disfavor with his superiors. After returning to the United States he resigned from the Communist Party and associated with the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party. In 1941, he was drafted into the Army, serving as a combat paratrooper in the 517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team until his discharge in November 1945.",Peter Asheton Sturgeon,http://www.alba-valb.org/volunteers/peter-asheton-sturgeon,NA,Peter,Sturgeon
